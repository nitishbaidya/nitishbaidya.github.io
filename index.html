                        <p>Hey there — I’m a data analytics professional with around 9 years of experience turning raw, often chaotic data into something clear, useful, and actionable. I’ve led teams, built scalable analytics solutions, and helped execs across industries make smarter decisions (or at least fewer guesses).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of AI — I’m still new to it, but I'm putting in the work and building things as I go. It's been a mix of reading, experimenting, and a fair bit of trial and error. I'm especially interested in how AI and public data can be used together to drive meaningful insights in the real world.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                                    <h3>Early Days: Hustling with Insights & Presentations</h3>
                                    <p>My analytics story kicked off in the trenches — survey design, dashboards, competitive intelligence, the whole grind. I was working with companies like Nielsen, Kantar, and Infiniti, trying to make sense of market chaos and customer behaviour. It wasn't glamorous, but it taught me how data moves businesses (and how to spot nonsense in spreadsheets). Somewhere in the middle of all that, I discovered I actually liked presenting. Whether it was for a client pitch or a strategy update, I started putting together decks that didn't put people to sleep — and got good at breaking down the geeky stuff into stories people could run with. That skill stuck.</p>

                                    <h3>Turning Dashboards into Decisions</h3>
                                    <p>I got deeper into data storytelling — building dashboards that didn't just look pretty but actually helped people do their jobs better. One time I built a Power BI setup that replaced manual reporting completely for that business unit (cue happy analysts). Another time, I built a Looker dashboard that helped a retail brand tweak its campaign strategy — and they saw the results in their next sales cycle. That's when I realized: a good dashboard can punch way above its weight.</p>

                                    <p>Eventually, I started leading teams — cross-functional, cross-timezone, cross-your-fingers kinda teams. Engineers, analysts, product folks, frontend devs... we built systems, shipped stuff, solved weird problems, and tried not to break prod. I also mentored a bunch of folks along the way, which is one of the few things more satisfying than a clean deployment.</p>

                                    <p>Somewhere around this time, the AI bug bit me. I'm still early in the game, but I've been hands-on with building and deploying machine learning models that do real work — predicting trends, automating workflows, surfacing the good stuff from the noise. These days, I'm tinkering with LLMs like Gemma and DeepSeek, running things locally with Ollama, and getting friendly with tools like Nvidia NIM. Not quite a wizard yet, but getting there.</p>

                                    <p>I took a detour into research at Technische Universität Berlin, working on the Gaia-X initiative — an EU project focused on data governance and blockchain. I got to work with huge autonomous vehicle simulation datasets (which was kind of awesome) and helped shape the narrative for presentations that were later shown at major conferences. I didn't present myself, but I had a hand in what went up on the big screen.</p>

                                    <h3>Clients, Sectors, and Side Quests</h3>
                                    <p>I've consulted for brands like PwC, Logitech, Marks & Spencer, Parachute, and a bunch more. Projects have ranged from data pipelines to brand campaign insights to automation fixes that saved people from death-by-spreadsheet. Lately, I've been nerding out over public datasets and wondering how AI and policy tech could make public decision-making a little less messy. That's one of my current side quests.</p>
